# Bengaluru-Housing-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Bengaluru using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze real estate data, extract meaningful features, and build a regression model to provide accurate price predictions.  

#Project Overview
- Collected and preprocessed Bengaluru housing dataset.  
- Performed **data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering (location encoding, BHK/size transformation, etc.).  
- Built and evaluated regression models with a focus on LGBMRegressor (LightGBM) for high performance.  
- Visualized key insights and trends in the housing market.  

#Tech Stack & Tools
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- LightGBM (LGBMRegressor) 
- Jupyter Notebook
